<h1>Web Browser Technology</h1>
<body>
A web browser acts as a client to connect to and display content from a web server. It is, at its core, a user interface to display, search and interact with the World Wide Web. “A web browser is a software that enables users to access and view content on the World Wide Web. Its primary function is to locate and retrieve web pages, images, videos, documents, and other files from servers and display them on the user’s device. When you type a website’s URL into the browser and hit Enter, the browser sends a request to the server where the website’s files are stored using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. The server responds by sending back files, usually written in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, which the browser interprets and displays as a web page.” (Kitakabee, 2023) Web browsers function by using several internet protocols to communicate with web severs to provide and properly display their information. “When a user accesses a website by typing a URL like https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ into the browser, the browser first contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) server to translate the domain name into an IP address, such as 52.85.142.233. After obtaining the IP address, the browser sends a request to the corresponding web server. The web server processes this request and responds with the required content, including HTML, CSS, images, and scripts. The browser then uses this content to display the webpage to the user. A browser helps us find information anywhere on the internet. It is installed on the client's computer and requests information from the web server; such a type of working model is called a client-server model. The browser receives information through HTTP protocol. In which transmission of data is defined. When the browser received data from the server, it is rendered in HTML to user-readable form and, information is displayed on the device screen.” (GeeksforGeeks, 2021) Browsers are also used to store small pieces of information from the visited websites on the host computer. This information includes session and history information, settings, and most contentiously, tracking information for targeted advertising. These small pieces of information are collectively called cookies. “The Cookie is a small message from a web server passed to the user's browser when you visit a website. In other words, Cookies are small text files of information created/updated when visiting a website and stored on the user's web browser. Cookies are commonly used for information about user sections, user preferences and other data on the website. Cookies help websites remember users and track their activities to provide a personalised experience.” (GeeksforGeeks, 2023) In addition to this information, I found the following from Mozilla to be very interesting. “For the most part, browsers are considered single-threaded. That is, they execute a task from beginning to end before taking up another task.” (Populating the Page: How Browsers Work - Web Performance | MDN, 2025)  I find the fact that web browser are still considered single threaded in today’s dominantly multithreaded, multiprocessor world to be very interesting. Additionally, I wanted to include that source as it is very thorough on the process of how a web browser works, but is difficult to cite due to the method by which it breaks down its information.
