<h1>History</h1>
<body>
The history of web browser begins in 1980, with the first browser coming in 1990 10years later.” While working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee created enquire, which served as the model for the current web browser.” (Chaz Elban, 2022) “The WorldWideWeb (not to be confused with the World Wide Web) was the first browser ever created by W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee, then renamed Nexus to differentiate from the actual World Wide Web. Unlike today, this was the only browser and the only way to access the web.” (McPeak, 2018) In 1992 Lynx a text-based browser was released. In 1993, the first browser with a GUI, Mosaic was released. “In 1993, everyone started becoming familiar with the concept of web browsers and was curious to develop the same. This led to the invention of the "Mosaic" by NCSA (National Centre for Supercomputing Applications) at the University of Illinois. It gained massive popularity as it was the first graphical browser that demonstrated the use of multimedia (images) on the web.” (GeeksforGeeks, 2023) In 1994 the first public internet browser was released, Netscape Navigator, to large popularity. In 1995 the so-called browser wars took place as several products hit the market vying for public attention. “By 1995, Netscape Navigator wasn’t the only way to get online. Computer software giant Microsoft licensed the old Mosaic code and built its own window to the web, Internet Explorer. The release sparked a war. Netscape and Microsoft worked feverishly to make new versions of their programs, each attempting to outdo the other with faster, better products. Netscape created and released JavaScript, which gave websites powerful computing capabilities they never had before. (They also made the infamous <blink> tag.) Microsoft countered with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which became the standard for web page design. Things got a little out of hand in 1997 when Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4.0. The team built a giant letter “e” and snuck it on the lawn of Netscape headquarters. The Netscape team promptly knocked the giant “e” over and put their own Mozilla dinosaur mascot on top of it. Then Microsoft began shipping Internet Explorer with their Windows operating system. Within 4 years, it had 75% of the market and by 1999 it had 99% of the market. The company faced antitrust litigation over the move, and Netscape decided to open source its codebase and created the not-for-profit Mozilla, which went on to create and release Firefox in 2002.” ((Browser History: Epic Power Struggles That Brought Us Modern Browsers, 2015) As alluded to in the description above, in 1998 Netscape made its code open source and created Mozilla and the Mozilla Firefox browser that is still popular today. In 1996 Opera software released the Opera web browser. In 2003 Apple release Safari for their systems and in 2008 Google released Chrome which quickly grew to dominate the market, with Microsoft edge adopting chromium as it’s underlying technology in 2020. “As of today, Microsoft’s default web browser is officially shifting to an open-source engine best known for powering a rival browser. Let that sink in for a second, and you’ll get a sense for just how much the tech world has turned upside down in the last decade. A little more than a year after announcing the plan, Microsoft on Wednesday morning released its reborn Edge browser for Windows and Mac, rebuilt on the open-source Chromium project — the same underlying technology that powers Google’s rival Chrome browser.” (Bishop, 2020)
